# Sudoku Solver

Simple sudoku solver i made to review some concepts. Its made on Java and it uses a backtracking technique to find (if feasible) a solution.

## Getting Started

For using it you just have to download it, and run it. 

### Prerequisites

It runs on JRE 11.0, but im pretty sure you can use almost every modern JRE.
